# Fabulously Enhanced
Fabulously Enhanced is a pack that improves performance by a lot, without making your game looking worse.
The pack uses some client-side mods, but it should fully work on server with the modpack not installed.

This pack adds a few neat features, which include:
- Journeymap
- Zoomify
- Freelook
- Jade
- No Chat Reports
- Calcmod
- Graves
- REI
- Invmove
- And many more!
You can view the mod list in Versions on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulouslyenhanced/versions#all-versions).
